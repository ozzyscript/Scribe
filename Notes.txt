NOTE:
This file is not well organized, but you can consider 
it a simple guide.

========== Libs installed ============

Note: Create a virtual env first then install inside it.

Main:  
pip install phidata groq python-dotenv python-telegram-bot

Tools: 
pip install duckduckgo-search googlesearch-python pycountry wikipedia



======== Things you need to do after installation ========

Create an account on groq website (For Ai models and (Free Api keys))
https://console.groq.com/keys

Get API key from telegram bot (@BotFather) make it sure has a blue mark.


======== Things to keep in mind =======

Store API keys in .env file
Before doing "git add" add .env file to .ignore file. 



======== Challenging parts ========

The most challenging part was writing the right prompt for the agent,to make it act exactly as I want.


========= Things I have learned ==========

Side-effect vs Pure functions
Side Effects — Quick Rule

A function has side effects if it does anything beyond returning a value.

A function HAS side effects if it:
Reads or writes files
Calls the network / APIs / LLMs
Prints, logs, or outputs to the user
Modifies global variables
Modifies objects passed into it
Depends on time or randomness
Exits or affects program flow

A function is side-effect free (pure) if:
Same input → same output
No I/O
No mutation outside the function
No time, randomness, or globals

========== Better code =========

---- SET SUBTRACTION WAY ----
REQUIRED_KEYS = {"A", "B", "C"}
data = {"A": 1, "C": 3}
missing = REQUIRED_KEYS - data.keys() 

---- TRADITIONAL WAY ----
missing = []
for k in REQUIRED_KEYS:
    if k not in data:
        missing.append(k)




====== How I was thinking while building the Agent =======

Q: What a Scribe is?
A: It is an Ai Agent that 
1 Org ideas
2 validate statements
3 search internet for questions
4 give recommendations  

=====================
It must return data in JSON format

List of Tools [
Wikipdia, Google-search, Duck-Duck-Go
]


=====================
Work Flow:
User => add content to the .txt file
Agent => pull that content, org it, answer questions, provide suggestions 
         return all that as JSON format file.
Dev => org that content and return it as .md file.

=====================
Things to do:
create a venv env []
install phidata, groq, tools list []
create account on groq []
get the api-key []

=====================
Installed:
